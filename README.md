Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Amazon E-Commerce dataset. Formulated a clear problem statement and applied data-driven methodologies to address it. Utilized Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Derived actionable insights and presented findings through visualizations to support business decision-making. 
Here's the breakdown of my work ðŸ‘‡ :

â€¢ **Comprehensive Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Utilized pandas for data cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the Amazon e-commerce dataset for analysis.

â€¢ **Data Exploration and Summary Statistics:** Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights, trends, and patterns within the dataset using summary statistics, and visual tools.

â€¢ **Advanced Data Visualization:** Leveraged matplotlib and seaborn to create a variety of visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to interpret the data effectively.

â€¢ **Trend and Pattern Identification:** Identified key trends and patterns in customer behavior, product categories, and sales performance through visual analysis.

â€¢ **Insights for Business Strategy:** Provided actionable insights for improving business strategies, such as product recommendations, pricing strategies, and inventory management, based on data-driven visualizations.
